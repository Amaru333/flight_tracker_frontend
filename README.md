This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) can be accessed on [http://localhost:3000/api/hello](http://localhost:3000/api/hello). This endpoint can be edited in `pages/api/hello.js`.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.

## Deploy on Vercel

The easiest way to deploy your Next.js app is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme) from the creators of Next.js.

Check out our [Next.js deployment documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs/deployment) for more details.

## What it does
Fly Frenzy is a web application which finds the cheapest flight ticket price between two cities. The user can even subscribe to notifications, which notifies them whenever there's a cheaper option available between those two cities. The user gets an email and SMS with price, how much cheaper it is compared to the last time they saw the price, and even a link to the booking website. All these without signing up or any such lengthy processes.

## How we built it
We've used the following technologies to build our application:
- NextJS for front-end
- Python + Flask for back-end API and cron job
- MongoDB for database
- Courier for sending notifications

## How to contribute:
- Clone the repository
- Run `npm run dev`
- App will be running in `http://localhost:3000`
- Make changes and create a pull request
